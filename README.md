# Cycling_Calories_Predictor

This is a simple calorie predictor that I made end-to-end. The dataset is also developed by me, and is derived from my workout routine. 
The data contains 50 samples corresponding to 50 workouts of mine (cycling) 
The features are Av. Speed, Distance, Time, Av. Heart Rate, which are used to predict the Calories Burned.
I used a set of simple ML models including SVM, DecisionTreeRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, LassoCV & ElasticCV
